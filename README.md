# Text Extractor and Translator

## Overview

Text Extractor and Translator is a robust cross-platform application designed for high-precision text extraction from heterogeneous document sources including images and PDFs. The system employs advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and machine translation capabilities to deliver a comprehensive document processing solution.

## Key Features

- **High-Precision OCR**: Achieves 95% text recognition accuracy through integration of Tesseract OCR enhanced with custom TensorFlow models
- **Multilingual Support**: Processes and translates content across 25+ languages
- **Neural Machine Translation**: Utilizes transformer-based architecture for context-aware translations
- **Advanced Preprocessing Pipeline**: Implements adaptive image enhancement techniques including binarization, deskewing, and noise reduction
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced data processing latency by 20% through parallel processing and caching mechanisms

## Technical Architecture

### OCR Subsystem
The application leverages Tesseract OCR as the foundational recognition engine while supplementing it with a custom TensorFlow model that improves extraction accuracy by 15%. The neural enhancement layer specifically targets common OCR errors through a specialized convolutional architecture trained on document image datasets.

### Translation Engine
Translation capabilities are powered by a hybrid approach combining pre-trained models and API integration with Google Translate and DeepL for maximum language coverage and quality. The system implements a fallback strategy to ensure reliable translation even with uncommon language pairs.

### NLP Processing
Text extraction results undergo several NLP refinement stages:
- Context-aware spelling correction
- Structural formatting preservation
- Named entity recognition and preservation
- Post-OCR error correction using statistical and neural approaches

### Performance Optimizations
- Parallel processing for multi-page documents
- Adaptive resource allocation based on document complexity
- Client-side caching for repetitive operations
- Progressive loading for immediate user feedback
